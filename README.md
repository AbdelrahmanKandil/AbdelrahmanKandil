## üöÄ About Me
I'm a Software Testing Engineer at Sumerge with a strong background in embedded systems. I specialize in both manual and automated testing, focusing on delivering high-quality software through comprehensive quality assurance practices. My unique combination of testing expertise and embedded systems knowledge allows me to bring a technical depth to software quality assurance.

I began my journey through intensive training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI) and National Telecommunication Institute (NTI), where I built strong foundations in C/C++, RTOS, Python, and embedded development. During my time at Valeo Testing Academy, I deepened my knowledge of software testing life cycles, black-box and white-box techniques, and test case design.

At Sumerge, I contribute to delivering high-quality software by designing test cases, executing structured testing cycles, and tracking defects using tools like JIRA and IBM RTC. I apply quality assurance best practices across the SDLC and STLC, collaborating closely with developers and analysts to ensure robust releases.

I'm passionate about software quality, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I'm especially interested in roles that bridge software testing with embedded systems‚Äîwhere performance, precision, and reliability are essential.
